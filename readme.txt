Shop greener with Seesiu

Let's face it, we all love the convenience modern-day technology has brought to our lives, but we need a way to continue with our online shopping habits, without compromising our beautiful planet any further. We are all used to recycling, and ordering our daily coffee with a reusable cup - now it's time to make an easy switch to our online shopping habits to make them better for the environment as well.

What is Seesiu?

Seesiu is a plugin that helps online retailers give their customers the choice to make their deliveries greener. Whilst carbon offsetting isn't a new concept, Seesiu is a brand driven business built to allow shoppers to recognise our name and offset the carbon of their deliveries when they see the logo at checkout. We are fun, friendly and of course environmentally aware, and it's our goal to make shopping with Seesiu a no-brainer when buying anything online.

How does Seesiu work?

Adding Seesiu to the checkout section of the transaction gives your customers the chance to make their deliveries greener. All they have to do is select the Seesiu option in the checkout section and we do the faffy bit.

When shoppers add the Seesiu option at the checkout, a small fee of 75p will be added onto their transaction, and Seesiu uses that money to buy carbon offsets, which in turn make the deliveries green.

It's as simple as this:
* Download the Seesiu plugin, and add it to your e-commerce site
* Once the Seesiu plugin is activated it will appear in the checkout section with the caption 'Shop with Seesiu and make your delivery greener for just 75p! Click here to find out more'
* When shoppers opt in to shop with Seesiu, 75p is added to the transaction but you can go ahead and fulfil their order as normal
* We invoice you monthly for all Seesiu transactions and use that money to  procure carbon offsets, which in turn make your customers’ deliveries greener. Simple.

What are carbon offsets?

Put simply, carbon offsets are the 'good' done from projects all over the world which help us fight climate change. They are verified by independent bodies to ensure that they are doing exactly what they claim. 

Typically these projects fall into three categories: 
* Renewable energy projects
* Reforestation projects
* Energy efficiency projects
